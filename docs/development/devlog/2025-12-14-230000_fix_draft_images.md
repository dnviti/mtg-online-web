# Fix Draft Card Images

## Issue
Users reported that images were not showing in the Draft Card Selection UI.

## Root Causes
1.  **Missing Proxy**: The application was attempting to load cached images from `http://localhost:5173/cards/...`. Vite Dev Server (port 5173) was not configured to proxy these requests to the backend (port 3000), resulting in 404 errors for all local images.
2.  **Incorrect Property Access**: `DraftView.tsx` (and `DeckBuilderView.tsx`) attempted to access `card.image_uris.normal`. However, the `DraftCard` object generated by `PackGeneratorService` and modified by `LobbyManager` stores the image URL in `card.image`. This property was being ignored.

## Fixes
1.  **Vite Config**: Added a proxy rule for `/cards` in `src/vite.config.ts` to forward requests to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Frontend Views**: Updated `DraftView.tsx` and `DeckBuilderView.tsx` to prioritize `card.image` when rendering card images.

## Verification
-   Start the draft.
-   Images should now load correctly from the local cache (or fallback if configured).
-   Inspect network tab to verify images are loaded from `/cards/...` with a 200 OK status.
