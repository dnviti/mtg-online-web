# Bug Fix: Unconditional Foil Overlay

## Objective
Correct the issue where foil holographic animations were appearing on non-foil cards in the desktop view.

## Changes
- Modified `FloatingPreview` in `src/client/src/components/CardPreview.tsx`:
    - In the desktop return block, the code manually embedding the foil effect divs (introduced in a previous step) was missing the `{isFoil && ...}` conditional wrapper.
    - Replaced the manual div insertion with the `<FoilOverlay />` component, which encapsulates the foil logic correctly.
    - Wrapped this component call in the `{isFoil && <FoilOverlay />}` check to ensure it only renders for cards with `foil` or `etched` finishes.

## Result
Foil animations now strictly adhere to card metadata, appearing only on actual foil cards as intended. Normal cards display cleanly without any holographic overlay.
