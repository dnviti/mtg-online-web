# Resolve 413 Request Entity Too Large Errors

## Objective
Fix the "413 Request Entity Too Large" errors occurring during large uploads or requests after application deployment.

## Changes
1.  **Helm Chart Configuration (`helm/mtg-draft-maker/values.yaml`)**:
    *   Added Nginx Ingress annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "0"` to disable the body size limit check at the ingress level.

2.  **Server Configuration (`src/server/index.ts`)**:
    *   Increased `maxHttpBufferSize` for Socket.IO to 1GB.
    *   Increased `express.json` body parser limit to 1000MB to support large JSON payloads (e.g., extensive card lists).

## Verification
*   **Infrastructure**: Ensure the application is redeployed with the updated Helm chart for the ingress annotation to take effect.
*   **Application**: Verify that large payloads can be sent to the server without triggering 413 errors.
