# Draft Interface UI Polish

## Status
- [x] Analyze current UI issues (bottom border, scrolling).
- [x] Remove global padding from `App.tsx`.
- [x] Refactor `DraftView.tsx` for a cleaner, game-like experience.
- [x] Implement immersive 3D effects and tray-style pool view.

## Context
The user requested to improve the draft card pick interface. Specifically to remove the ugly bottom border, avoid page scrolls, and make it feel more like a game.

## Implementation Details

### `src/client/src/App.tsx`
- Removed `pb-20` from the main container to allow full-screen layouts without forced scrolling at the bottom.

### `src/client/src/modules/draft/DraftView.tsx`
- **Layout**: Changed to relative positioning with `overflow-hidden` to contain all elements within the viewport.
- **Visuals**:
    - Added a radial gradient background overlay.
    - Redesigned the "Current Pack" area with `[perspective:1000px]` and 3D hover transforms.
    - Redesigned the "Your Pool" bottom area to be a "tray" with `backdrop-blur`, gradient background, and removed the boxy border.
- **Scrollbars**: Hidden scrollbars in the main pack view for a cleaner look (`[&::-webkit-scrollbar]:hidden`).
