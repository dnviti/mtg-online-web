# Work Plan - Fix Pool Card Sizing

## Request
The user reported that cards in the horizontal pool list were "enormous" after previous changes.

## Changes
- **DraftView.tsx**:
    - Reverted the `height` class of `PoolCardItem` images (in horizontal mode) from `h-full` to `h-[90%]`.
    - `h-full` was causing the image to expand uncontrollably in some flex layouts, ignoring the parent container's constraints.
    - `h-[90%]`, combined with `items-center` on the parent container, properly constrains the image to fit within the strip, maintaining aspect ratio via `w-auto`.

## Verification
- **Visuals**: Cards in the bottom "Your Pool" strip should now cleanly fit within the resizeable panel, with a small vertical margin, instead of overflowing or appearing excessively large.
