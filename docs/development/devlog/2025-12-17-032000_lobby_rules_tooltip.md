### Lobby Rules Tooltip

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Description**
Added a dynamic tooltip and status indicator to the Online Lobby to explain draft capacity rules based on pack count.

**Changes**
1.  **Info Icon**: Added an `AlertCircle` icon with a hoverable tooltip explaining the pack requirements (3 packs/player).
2.  **Dynamic Rules**: The list of rules highlights the currently applicable tier based on pack count (e.g., turning green for "12-17 Packs" if 15 packs are available).
3.  **Status Line**: A summary line explicitly states "Supported Players: [Status]" under the pack count.

**Effect**
Users can now clearly see why they might need more packs before creating a room, and what player counts are supported with their current pool.
