# Card Zoom on Hover - Dedicated Zone

## Status
- [x] Add `hoveredCard` state to `DraftView` (Already done).
- [x] Implement `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` handlers (Already done).
- [x] Refactor `DraftView` layout to include a dedicated sidebar for card preview.
- [x] Move the zoomed card image into this dedicated zone instead of a fixed overlay.

## Implementation Details
-   **File**: `src/client/src/modules/draft/DraftView.tsx`
-   **Layout Change**:
    -   Wrap the central card selection area in a `flex-row` container.
    -   Add a Left Sidebar (e.g., `w-80`) reserved for the zoomed card.
    -   Ensure the main card grid takes up the remaining space (`flex-1`).
-   **Behavior**: When no card is hovered, the sidebar can show a placeholder or remain empty/decorative.
