# Fix UUID Error in Insecure Contexts

## Problem
The user reported a `TypeError: crypto.randomUUID is not a function` when accessing the application from a public IP. This is because `crypto.randomUUID()` is part of the Web Crypto API, which is often restricted to secure contexts (HTTPS) or localhost. When accessing via `http://PUBLIC_IP:PORT`, the browser disables this API.

## Solution
We need to implement a fallback UUID generation method that works in non-secure contexts.

## Plan
1.  Modify `src/client/src/services/PackGeneratorService.ts`.
2.  Add a private method `generateUUID()` to the `PackGeneratorService` class (or a standalone helper function in the module) that:
    *   Checks if `crypto.randomUUID` is available.
    *   If yes, uses it.
    *   If no, uses a fallback algorithm (e.g., `Math.random()` based v4 UUID generation).
3.  Replace the call `crypto.randomUUID()` with this new method.
