# Draft Cards Picker UI Update

## Task
Update the `DraftView` to implement a 3D-flipping card preview sidebar (consistent with the Deck Builder) and ensure foil cards are rendered correctly in both the preview and the main selection grid.

## Changes
- Modified `src/client/src/modules/draft/DraftView.tsx`:
  - Imported `FoilOverlay` component.
  - Defined `normalizeCard` helper to standardise card object structure (handling images and finish).
  - Added `displayCard` state to persist card details during the flip animation.
  - Replaced the previous fade-in sidebar with the 3D perspective flip container from `DeckBuilderView`.
  - Updated the card rendering loop in `activePack` to use `normalizeCard` and conditionally render `FoilOverlay` and foil-specific styles (purple glow, badges).

## Outcome
- **Sidebar**: Now features a persistent 3D flip animation. When hovering a card, it flips to show the front; when not hovering, it shows the card back (`/images/back.jpg`).
- **Foil Support**: Start using `FoilOverlay` for both the main draft grid and the sidebar preview, providing visual consistency for premium cards.
