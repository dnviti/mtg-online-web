# Cube Manager Full Width Layout

## Objective
Update the `CubeManager` layout to utilize the full width of the screen, removing the maximum width constraint. This allows for better utilization of screen real estate, especially on wider monitors, and provides more space for the pack grid.

## Changes
- Modified `src/client/src/modules/cube/CubeManager.tsx`:
    - Removed `max-w-7xl` and `mx-auto` classes from the main container.
    - Added `w-full` to ensure the container spans the entire available width.

## Result
The Cube Manager interface now stretches to fill the viewport width, providing a more expansive view for managing packs and settings.
