### Enhanced Toast Visibility

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Description**
Updated the Toast notification to be more prominent and centrally located, as per user feedback.

**Changes**
1.  **Position**: Moved from bottom-right to top-center (`top-6 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`).
2.  **Animation**: Changed to `slide-in-from-top-full` with a slight zoom-in effect.
3.  **Styling**:
    -   Increased padding (`px-6 py-4`).
    -   Increased border width (`border-2`) and brightness.
    -   Added stronger shadows (`shadow-2xl`).
    -   Increased contrast for text and background.
    -   Increased font weight to `bold`.

**Effect**
Notifications are now impossible to miss, appearing top-center with a premium, game-like alert style.
