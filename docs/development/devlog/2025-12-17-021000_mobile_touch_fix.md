# Mobile Touch Interaction Logic

## Objective
Enhance mobile usability by modifying the long-press behavior. The preview should persist while the user moves their finger across the screen (e.g., to inspect different parts of the card or simply drift) and only disappear upon releasing the finger (`touchend`).

## Changes
- Modified `src/client/src/components/CardPreview.tsx`:
    - Updated `handleTouchMove` in `CardHoverWrapper`.
    - Removed the `setIsLongPressing(false)` call inside the movement threshold check.
    - **Logic**:
        - If the user moves their finger *before* the 500ms long-press timer completes, the timer is cleared (canceling the preview), interpreting the action as a scroll.
        - If the user moves their finger *after* the preview has appeared (`isLongPressing` is true), the movement is ignored, and the preview **remains visible**.
    - The preview is now effectively closed only by `handleTouchEnd` (lifting the finger).

## Result
This creates a much more forgiving and "tactile" experience on mobile, allowing users to hold their thumb on a card and shift it slightly without the preview abruptly vanishing.
