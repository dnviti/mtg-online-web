# Cube Manager Archidekt View

## Objective
Implement an "Archidekt-style" stacked view for pack generation. This view organizes cards into columns by type (Creature, Instant, Land, etc.) with vertical overlapping to save space while keeping headers visible.

## Changes
1.  **Refactor PackCard**: Extracted `FloatingPreview` and `CardHoverWrapper` into `src/client/src/components/CardPreview.tsx` to resolve circular dependencies and clean up `PackCard.tsx`.
2.  **Update StackView**:
    -   Rewrite `StackView.tsx` to group cards by `typeLine` (categories: Creature, Planeswalker, Instant, Sorcery, Enchantment, Artifact, Land, Battle, Other).
    -   Sort cards within categories by CMC.
    -   Render columns using Flexbox.
    -   Implement overlapping "card strip" look using negative `margin-bottom` on cards.
    -   Value tuning: `margin-bottom: -125%` seems appropriate for a standard card aspect ratio to reveal the title bar.

## Result
The "Stack" view option in Cube Manager now renders packs as organized, sorted columns similar to deck-builder interfaces.
