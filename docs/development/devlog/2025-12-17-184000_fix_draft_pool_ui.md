# Fix Draft UI Issues

## Task
Fix bugs in the Draft Pick UI related to the "Your Pool" section.

## Changes
- Modified `src/client/src/modules/draft/DraftView.tsx`:
  - **Resize Handle Fix**: Updated the resize event listeners (`mousemove`, `mouseup`) to be attached to `document` instead of `window`. This ensures the resize action continues smoothly even if the mouse leaves the browser window or moves rapidly over iframes/other elements that might swallow events.
  - **Remove Hover Effect**: Removed the `hover:-translate-y-10` class from the drafted card items in the bottom pool view. The cards will now remain stationary on hover, as requested.

## Outcome
- The pool resizing experience is now consistent and does not lose focus when dragging quickly.
- Cards in the "Your Pool" strip no longer jump up when hovered, providing a stable viewing experience.
