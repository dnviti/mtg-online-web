## TODO

- [ ] In constructed formats, unlike limited, the deck builder must not be reopened before redy for match
- [ ] In commander format the commander is not put into the command zone at the start of the game
- [ ] In commander format the player cannot draw the commander from the command zone because there is no option in the right click menu
