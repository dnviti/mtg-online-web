# Game Type Filter for Expansion Selection

## Objective
Add a filter to the "From Expansion" set selection to easily distinguish between Paper and Digital (MTGA/MTGO) sets.

## Implementation Details
1.  **ScryfallService Update**: Updated `ScryfallSet` interface to include the `digital` boolean property and mapped it in `fetchSets`.
2.  **CubeManager UI**: Added a toggle filter bar above the set list with three options:
    *   **All**: Shows all sets.
    *   **Paper**: Shows only sets where `digital` is false.
    *   **Digital**: Shows only sets where `digital` is true.
3.  **Filter Logic**: Integrated the game type filter into the existing search filter logic in `CubeManager`.

## Status
Completed. Users can now filter the expansion list by game type.
