### Unified Toast Design

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2025-12-17

**Description**
Refined the Toast notification design to align perfectly with the "Dark Gaming Aesthetic" of the platform.

**Changes**
1.  **Consistent Palette**: Switched to `bg-slate-800` (cards) with `border-slate-700` equivalents, using colored accents only for borders and icons.
2.  **Icon Enclosure**: Icons are now housed in a circular, semi-transparent colored background (`bg-emerald-500/10`) for a polished look.
3.  **Typography**: Reverted to standard font weights used in other UI cards (`font-medium`) for better readability and consistency.
4.  **Shadows**: Tuned shadows to be deep but subtle (`shadow-2xl shadow-emerald-900/20`), matching the ambient lighting of the app.

**Effect**
The Toast now feels like a native part of the UI rather than a generic alert overlay.
