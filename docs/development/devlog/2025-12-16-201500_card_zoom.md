# Card Zoom on Hover

## Status
- [x] Add `hoveredCard` state to `DraftView`.
- [x] Implement `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` handlers for cards in both Pick and Pool areas.
- [x] rendering a fixed, high z-index preview of the hovered card.
- [x] Disable right-click context menu on Draft interface.

## Implementation Details
-   **File**: `src/client/src/modules/draft/DraftView.tsx`
-   **Zoom Component**: A fixed `div` containing the large card image.
-   **Position**: Fixed to the left or right side of the screen (e.g., `left-10 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`) to avoid covering the grid being interacted with (which is usually centered).
-   **Styling**: Large size (e.g., `w-80` or `h-[500px]`), shadow, border, rounded corners.
