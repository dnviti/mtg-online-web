# Work Plan - Touch Resize Implementation

## Request
The user reported that resizing handles were not working on touchscreen devices.

## Changes
- **DraftView.tsx**:
    - Replaced `handleMouseDown`, `onMouseMove`, `onMouseUp` with unified `handleResizeStart`, `onResizeMove`, `onResizeEnd`.
    - Added logic to detect `touches` in event object and extract `clientX`/`clientY` from the first touch point.
    - Attached `onTouchStart` to sidebar and pool resize handles.
    - Added `passive: false` to touch event listeners (via `useEffect` logic or direct attach) to call `e.preventDefault()`, preventing page scrolling while dragging. Note: Implemented in the handler function with `if (e.cancelable) e.preventDefault()`.
    - Added `touch-none` utility class to resize handles to structurally prevent browser touch actions.

- **DeckBuilderView.tsx**:
    - Implemented the exact same unified handler logic as DraftView.
    - Updated both Sidebar (vertical) and Pool (horizontal) resize handles with `onTouchStart`.

## Verification
- **Touch**: Dragging handles on a touchscreen (mobile/tablet) should now resize the panels smoothly.
- **Mouse**: Mouse interaction remains unchanged and performant (using `requestAnimationFrame`).
